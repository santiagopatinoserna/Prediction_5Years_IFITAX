# ðŸš€  Welcome to Godi.AI's Predictive 5-Year Analysis with XGBoost (the best model previously identified for this project).

Hello, business innovator! ðŸŒŽ I'm [Santiago PATINO SERNA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santiago-patino/), the CEO and data scientist at [Godi.AI](https://godi.ai/). This notebook showcases the deployment of the Xgboost model, identified as the optimal choice for this dataset in a previous notebook. There, various models were tested and the best one selected, along with its hyperparameters. [Notebook for model selection on Github](https://github.com/santiagopatinoserna/TensorFlow_Prediction_5YearFrench_IFI/blob/main/Script/Model_selection_ML_NN.ipynb). In this notebook, we will read and clean the data using the previously developed code. Following this, the model will be trained using the Xgboost algorithm and the best hyperparameters identified earlier. The focus will be on deploying the model for production, which involves training the model with the entire dataset. Additionally, we'll construct a dataframe containing data to predict unknown values. This process will include a loop where each iteration uses the latest prediction to forecast the next value.

### Deployment of the IFI Tax Model for Predicting 5-Year Trends in French Cities

- **Data Loading/Cleaning/Feature Engineering Construction**: The code for this process is replicated here from the previously mentioned project. This stage involved developing the base for our predictive analysis.
- **Construction of the Prediction DataFrame**: We create the X variables from past data to predict the unknown Y values, focusing on how historical trends can inform future outcomes.
- **Training the Algorithm with All Data**: The model training utilized 100% of the known data, following prior validations. Outlier city data, which could skew the model, were excluded to ensure accuracy.
-**Prediction for Year+1**: We employ the trained model to predict the first year, initiating our forward-looking analysis.
-**Prediction Loop**: A loop for predicting X years is initiated, using the previously predicted value as the X variable for the next year's prediction. This iterative process builds upon each successive prediction.
-**Visualization of Predictions**: Graphical representations of the predictions are created, providing a visual understanding of the projected IFI tax trends in French cities.
-**Outlier Prediction**: Since outliers were excluded from the main model, a rapid auxiliary model, Prophet, is used specifically for these cities. This approach strictly follows their historical trends to forecast their future IFI tax values.
